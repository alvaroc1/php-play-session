Motivation
==========

Make it possible to migrate a PHP site to the play framework in pieces.
It is not pretty, but it works. Use at your own risk.

If there is a better way, let me know :)

Setup
=====

Configure the webserver to proxy the sections that will be handled by the play framework
to the port in which the play site is running on (probably 9000).

Configure PHP to buffer all output:
  php.ini:
  output_buffering = On

Include play-session.php in all the php site pages (some sort of include, of course) and
configure:
  <?php
  ...
  usePlaySessionHandler(
    'PLAY',                  // cookie name, must match the cookie name set on the play! app
    'secret-key-replace-me', // secret key, must match the key from the play! app
  );

You must manually close the session using session_write_close() on ALL php pages.
It shouldn't be too hard if you are using a framework.

Make sure that any page that sets a session value, redirects, and dies, manually closes the 
session before dying.
